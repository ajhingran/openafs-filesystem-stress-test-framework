# Open AFS Stress Testing Framework

## Capabilities
Currently the tester runs the operations defined inside of fileoperations.h over 1600 files in a random order and sequence.
As it stands the tester runs two executables in parallel, with each executable operating on 800 of the files over a 5 minute time frame. 
                                                                                                                            
Files opened during the test are logged inside of **files-used.txt**

## Initialization
Run ```make init``` to establish the test files and test directories. Directories will be in the format of **testFiles-#**

## Run
Run ```make run``` to run the tester. 

*Note:* Two warnings for *execvp* will pop up but that will be fixed in a later version and have no impact on the tester

## Reset
Run ```make clean``` to remove the test directories, files, and any files generated by the test suite

Run ```make reset``` to clean, setup, and run the test suite again

## Experimental Work
**Configurability** is currently being experimented in the experimental branch to allow for customization in the number of
processes spawned, files operated on, length of operations, among other features

**Optimization** is being worked on to improve the readability and remove the repetitiveness in the current testing suite
